# ableton-mcp-max — Progress

**Current focus:** Phase 0 + Phase 1 live-verified against Live 11 Suite. Ready to plan Phase 2 (Mixer & Routing).
**Next action:** Plan Phase 2 (Mixer & Routing).

## Phases
| Phase | Title | Status | Completed |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| 0 | Foundation (fork + parity + install) | Live-verified | 2026-05-24 |
| 1 | Device & Parameter Control | Live-verified | 2026-05-24 |
| 2 | Mixer & Routing | Not started | |
| 3 | Clip & MIDI Editing | Not started | |
| 4 | Devices & Racks | Not started | |
| 5 | Scenes, Transport, Arrangement | Not started | |
| 6 | Automation Envelopes | Not started | |
| 7 | Change Listeners (stretch) | Not started | |

## Phase 0 tools (parity, vendored) — live-verified (get_session_info + get_track_info confirmed; rest vendored unchanged from ahujasid)
- [x] get_session_info, get_track_info, create_midi_track, set_track_name,
      create_clip, add_notes_to_clip, set_clip_name, set_tempo, fire_clip,
      stop_clip, start_playback, stop_playback, load_instrument_or_effect,
      get_browser_tree, get_browser_items_at_path, load_drum_kit

## Phase 1 tools
- [x] param_utils.resolve_parameter_index (offline unit tests: 6/6 pass)
- [x] get_device_parameters (live: Wavetable, 93 params read w/ value_items)
- [x] set_device_parameter (live: by-name continuous + quantized, index clamping 999→48 all OK; values restored)

## Deployment state
- MCP server registered as **AbletonMCPMax** for project `abletonwork`
  (`uv run --directory ~/git/ableton-mcp-max ableton-mcp-max`); old `AbletonMCP`
  (uvx ahujasid) removed from that project.
- Remote Script installed at
  `/Applications/Ableton Live 11 Suite.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts/AbletonMCP/`
  (original ahujasid script backed up to `AbletonMCP.bak.*` alongside it).
- Requires: quit+reopen Live (load new handlers), restart Claude Code (load new tools).

## Device parameter reachability notes
- Wavetable: 93 automatable params exposed. Quantized params (Device On, Osc On,
  Filter Type/LP-HP/Slope, Sub Transpose, Loop Modes, LFO Shape/Sync/Retrigger)
  expose value_items and are settable by integer index. Continuous params settable
  by float; out-of-range values clamp to min/max. Settable by name (case-insensitive)
  or index. No menu-only/unreachable controls observed at the device top level.
